    <h1>About the website</h1>
    <h2>The idea</h2>
    <p class="text1">The environment and especially the emission of greenhouse gases such as CO<sub>2</sub> or methane are probably one of the most important issues of our time, if not the most important of all, as they have a significant impact on how the world will look in the future.<br />
      <br />
      This website allows you to easily retrieve data on the respective countries and view them in simple charts. In addition, the countries can be compared with each other. You can see quite clearly which countries have the largest share of global pollution compared to others. It becomes particularly clear when rich industrialized countries are compared with poorer developing countries.<br />
      <br />
      The data covers the period between 1800 and 2020 for most countries.
